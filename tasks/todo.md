# Live edge-contract repair

- [x] Bound `drawing_state` summary output while preserving useful counts.
- [x] Reject low-confidence or destructive nonsense catalog matches.
- [x] Make `author_tool` approval replay use the app-minted confirmation ID.
- [x] Dispatch approved chat authoring through the existing author service.
- [x] Restore the SDK pre-tool permission callback.
- [x] Add focused negative and positive regression tests.
- [x] Run harness, server, type, build, and full repository gates.
- [x] Review the final diff and document contract changes in code and tests.

Risks: approval binding is security-sensitive; catalog changes must not hide valid tools; output bounding must not break existing clients.

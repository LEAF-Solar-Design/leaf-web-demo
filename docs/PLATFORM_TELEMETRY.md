# LEAF Platform product-event telemetry (contract of record)

Design of record: the P2 events layer (audit package
`C:/tmp/leaf-platform-telemetry/events_design.md`, 2026-07-30). This doc is
the CONTRACT both the emitters (this repo) and every dashboard query
(ops-dashboard) cite. Modeled on ops-dashboard's `TELEMETRY_STRUCTURE.md`.

## What this layer is, and is not

Product events add IDENTITY (tenant, user, session) to what the platform
already measures. They deliberately do NOT carry:
- reliability/cost counting (CloudWatch EMF `Leaf/Platform/APS` owns SLOs
  and alarms),
- billing numbers (`broker_usage_ledger` + `/api/usage` + the ops read-API
  are the money authority; BigQuery telemetry is directional),
- chat transcripts (deep per-turn forensics stay in `session_events` /
  `agent_ledger`).
Telemetry is loss-tolerant BY CONTRACT and can never break the product:
bounded queue, drop-oldest, kill switch, never-raise emitters.

## Storage

- Dataset `leaf_platform_analytics` (same GCP project the ops-dashboard
  reader already uses; sibling to `branch_analytics`). Dataset default
  table expiration: 425 days.
- Date-sharded tables `leaf_platform_events_YYYYMMDD`, wildcard-queried as
  `leaf_platform_events_*` (the exemplar's `_TABLE_SUFFIX` idioms port
  unchanged). Sharding, not native partitioning, on purpose.
- Promoted columns: `timestamp` (server-stamped), `event_type`,
  `event_name`, `tenant_id`, `tenant_kind` (guest/account/anon),
  `user_email` (NULLABLE; account only, from verified auth),
  `session_id`, `environment` (EVERY query floors on this),
  `app_version`, `labels` (JSON; ALL values strings).
- `schema_version` (currently "1") rides in `labels`. Additive-only within
  a version; a breaking change bumps it AND records a `_TABLE_SUFFIX`
  cutover floor here on day one.

## Envelope and naming

- `event_type` vocabulary: `custom_event | error | exception | page_view`.
- `event_name`: `domain.action`, lowercase snake, exactly one dot,
  past-tense verbs. Walls are always `<domain>.wall_hit` + `wall_kind`.
- Identity is SERVER-STAMPED from the verified principal, never trusted
  from a client payload. Guests never carry an email. No raw IPs, no
  drawing names/paths (ids only), no prompt text (`text_len` only), no
  tokens of any kind.
- Correlation contract: every `error`/`exception` event MUST carry `tool`
  when a tool flow is active; every run-lane event MUST carry `job_id`
  once one exists. Analytics quality depends on emitters honoring this.
- Client timestamps ride in labels as `client_ts`, clamped to +-24h of
  server time; the `timestamp` column is always the server clock.

## Ingest

- Server emitters: `telemetry_sink.emit(...)` in-process (bounded queue
  2000, batches of 250 or 2 s, BigQuery `insertAll` with day-table
  auto-create, drop-oldest on overflow, one stderr line per dropped
  batch).
- Client events: `POST /api/telemetry` `{schema_version, session_id,
  events:[{event_type, event_name, client_ts, labels}]}`, max 50 events /
  32 KB. Always answers `202 {accepted: n}` (validation drops, oversize,
  sink overflow, disabled sink included): the client can never observe a
  telemetry failure. Auth rides the platform's existing stack (Auth0
  bearer / guest HMAC / mock tenant); anonymous callers may send exactly
  `gate.choice | site.demo_viewed | tour.started` behind a per-IP token
  bucket, recorded as tenant "anon".

## Config (staging first; prod rides the normal deploy train)

- `LEAF_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` — kill switch (mirrors `APS_EMF_DISABLED`).
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON` — insert-only service account for
  the ONE dataset (NEVER the ops-dashboard reader SA), via AWS Secrets
  Manager + terraform.
- `LEAF_TELEMETRY_DATASET` (default `leaf_platform_analytics`),
  `LEAF_TELEMETRY_TABLE_PREFIX` (default `leaf_platform_events_`),
  `BIGQUERY_PROJECT_ID` (defaults to the SA's project),
  `LEAF_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT` (staging/production; mandatory, shared
  dataset), `LEAF_APP_VERSION` (build sha).
- Dependency boundary: `google-cloud-bigquery` ships in the APP image only
  (`server/requirements-telemetry.txt`, installed by `Dockerfile.app`).
  The broker image stays SDK-free; `telemetry_sink` reports disabled where
  the SDK or credentials are absent.

## Events live in v1 (this PR wave)

| Event | Source | Labels live today |
|---|---|---|
| `job.terminal` | server, `jobs.complete_callback` (both store modes) | job_id, status, tool, duration_ms (pg mode), error_code, attempts, execution_path |
| `agent.turn_completed` | server, `turn_runner._finalize_terminal` | turn_id, stop_reason, model, grant_kind, degraded, tools_called_n, usd_est, tokens_in, tokens_out |
| client ingest door | `POST /api/telemetry` | pre-auth trio + any valid authed event |

The remaining taxonomy (author/grant/drawing/org walls and funnels, the
client tracker's ~25 call sites) lands in the follow-up waves; labels are
additive within schema_version 1, so early rows stay queryable. Fields
named by the design but not yet stamped (e.g. `user_email`, `aps_live`,
`wrote_version`) arrive additively with those waves.

## Verification (binary, per the design)

After deploy: send one canary event and read it back from
`leaf_platform_events_*`; then break the SA credential in staging and
confirm every product path still answers 2xx while only the sink's stderr
drop line changes.
